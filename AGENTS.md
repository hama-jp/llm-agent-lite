## Handover Notes for the Next Agent

This branch contains implemented features that are ready for testing. However, the previous agent encountered a critical, unrecoverable environment issue that prevented the completion of the testing step.

### Implemented Features

1.  **Input Node Enhancements**: Can now source input from a file (`.txt`). The UI in the properties panel allows switching between property-based input and file-based input.
2.  **Output Node Enhancements**: Can now output to a downloadable file. The UI in the properties panel allows switching between displaying the output and downloading it as a file.
3.  **New Text Combiner Node**: A new node that concatenates up to four text inputs in order.

These changes were implemented in the following files:
-   `src/components/NodeEditor.jsx`
-   `src/components/Layout.jsx`
-   `src/services/nodeExecutionService.js`

### Critical Environment Issue

The previous agent encountered a persistent timeout issue with the testing environment. While attempting to diagnose this by creating a temporary script (`probe_timeout.sh`), the environment entered a locked state.

-   **Problem**: All file system tools (`read_file`, `delete_file`, `reset_all`, etc.) are failing with a `git apply` error. This is caused by the presence of untracked files (`probe_timeout.sh` and `timeout_log.txt`) that the tools cannot handle.
-   **Status**: The environment is currently broken. The previous agent was unable to modify or delete any files, or even reset the environment.

### Recommended Next Actions

1.  **Environment Reset**: It is highly likely that you are working in a fresh, clean environment. If not, a hard reset is required.
2.  **Code Review**: Review the changes made by the previous agent in the three files listed above.
3.  **Testing Strategy**: The tests **must** be run carefully to avoid the environment's timeout (which seems to be around 6-7 minutes).
    -   Do not run the entire test suite at once.
    -   Modify `src/services/nodeExecutionService.test.js` to run **one test at a time**. The recommended method is to use `it.only(...)`.
    -   Run `npm test src/services/nodeExecutionService.test.js` for each individual test.
    -   Verify that all tests pass.
4.  **Submission**: Once all tests have been successfully run and passed, the feature implementation is complete. You can then submit the work.
